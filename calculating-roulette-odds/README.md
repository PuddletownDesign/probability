# Calculating the odds of winning roulette

![roulette](http://tinyimg.io/i/vdy45wO.png)

## Probability percentages to calculate

1.  Getting a particular color
2.  Getting a 1 particular number
3.  Getting a particular number with `x` bets placed (most importantly combinations of 2, 4, 6 and 12 numbers)

## We will make the following assumptions

1.  The wheel has 2 `00` spaces. 2 losing slots
2.  There are 36 numbers (+ 2 losing slots) for 38 slots total
3.  The colors alternate between red and black (1 is red, 2 is black, etc...)
4.  We calculate for only 1 spin
5.  We will not be concerned with the payouts
