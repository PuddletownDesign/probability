# `r` Coin Flip

## Tasks

# Part 1

Using `r` program a generator calculates the probability of getting all heads and
the probability of getting at least one tails when flipping a coin x number of times

# Part 2

Now extend the program written in part 1 to prompt the user for a sequence (see below) and provide the probability of that sequence occurring when a coin is flipped x number of times.  

example:

-   HH is 25% chance
-   HHH is 12.5% chance
-   HTH is 12.5% chance

Make sure decimals are converted into percentages.

**Use your own folder for code samples and take notes in `README.md`**

## Solutions

```r
cf <- function(x) {
    flips <- x # the pass parameter of number of flips
    outcomes <- 2 # number of possible outcomes each flip
    totalOutcomes <- outcomes**x # total number of outcomes
    decimal <- 1/totalOutcomes # a decimal of the probability
    percent <- decimal * 100 # percentage of probability
    paste(c(percent, "%"), collapse = " ") # concatenating the string with percent sign
}
```
