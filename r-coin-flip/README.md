# Part 1

Using `r` program a generator calculates the probability of getting all heads and
the probability of getting at least one tails when flipping a coin x number of times

# Part 2

Now extend the program written in part 1 to prompt the user for a sequence (see below) and provide the probability of that sequence occurring when a coin is flipped x number of times.  

example:

-   HH is 25% chance
-   HHH is 12.5% chance
-   HTH is 12.5% chance

Make sure decimals are converted into percentages.
