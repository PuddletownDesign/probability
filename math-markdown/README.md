# Writing LATEX math symbols in a Github README

Sadly github is not well set up to display math using LATEX. The current best solution is to convert it to an image and link it.

## Steps

1.  Use the following site to convert the LATEX into an image. <https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php>
2.  Download the image and upload it to: <http://tinyimg.io>.
3.  Preseve the LATEX by including it into a code block below the image.    

### Example output

```latex
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2b}
```
